# the-emotion-of-words-
This project analyzes emotion rating data from a study comparing native English speakers (L1) and non-native English speakers (L2) in their perception of 2,628 words. Each word is rated on valence (how positive or negative it is) and arousal (the intensity of emotion it evokes) using a scale from 1 to 9. The analysis includes calculating measures of central tendency, variation, skewness, and kurtosis, as well as examining correlations between L1 and L2 ratings. Various visualizations, including histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots, are used to explore patterns and differences in emotional responses between native and non-native speakers.
